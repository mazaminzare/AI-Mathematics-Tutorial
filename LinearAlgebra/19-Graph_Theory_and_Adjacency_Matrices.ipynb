        "#### Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph theory is a field of mathematics focused on studying graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph consists of vertices (nodes) and edges (links) connecting pairs of vertices.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts in Graph Theory\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vertices and Edges**:\n",
        "    - **Vertices (or Nodes)**: The fundamental units of a graph, typically represented as dots or circles.\n",
        "    - **Edges (or Links)**: Connections between vertices, represented as lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Types of Graphs**:\n",
        "    - **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction. An edge between vertices $u$ and $v$ is represented as $(u, v)$.\n",
        "    - **Directed Graph (or Digraph)**: Edges have a direction. An edge from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is represented as $(u \\rightarrow v)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Degree of a Vertex**:\n",
        "    - **Undirected Graph**: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it.\n",
        "    - **Directed Graph**: The in-degree of a vertex is the number of incoming edges, and the out-degree is the number of outgoing edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Paths and Cycles**:\n",
        "    - **Path**: A sequence of vertices connected by edges.\n",
        "    - **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges or vertices.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Connected Graph**:\n",
        "    - **Undirected Graph**: A graph is connected if there is a path between any two vertices.\n",
        "    - **Directed Graph**: A graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from any vertex to every other vertex.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Adjacency Matrices\n",
        "\n",
        "An adjacency matrix is a way to represent a graph using a square matrix. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Undirected Graph**:\n",

        "#### Key Properties of Adjacency Matrices\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sparsity**: For large graphs, the adjacency matrix is often sparse (many zeros), especially if the number of edges is much less than the square of the number of vertices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Symmetry**: The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is symmetric.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Degree of a Vertex**: The degree of vertex $i$ in an undirected graph is the sum of the entries in row $i$ (or column $i$), and in a directed graph, the out-degree is the sum of the entries in row $i$ and the in-degree is the sum of the entries in column $i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Path Lengths**: Powers of the adjacency matrix can provide information about paths of different lengths. For example, the element $(i, j)$ of $\\mathbf{A}^k$ gives the number of paths of length $k$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Important Notes on Using Adjacency Matrices\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Computational Efficiency**: Adjacency matrices are useful for algorithms that benefit from matrix operations, such as finding the number of paths between vertices and eigenvalue-based graph analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Usage**: For sparse graphs, adjacency lists (which only store edges) are often more memory-efficient compared to adjacency matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Graph Algorithms**: Many graph algorithms, such as those for finding shortest paths (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) or detecting cycles, can be implemented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists.\n",
        "\n",
