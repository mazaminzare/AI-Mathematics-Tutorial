        "#### Important Notes on Using Tensor Algebra\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Computational Complexity**: Operations on high-dimensional tensors can be computationally expensive. Efficient algorithms and parallel computing techniques are often required.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Applications**: Tensors are widely used in various fields, including machine learning (tensor flow), physics (stress tensors, moment of inertia tensors), and computer graphics (transformation matrices).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Software Libraries**: Libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NumPy provide extensive support for tensor operations, making it easier to implement and optimize tensor algebra computations.\n",
