        "### Rank of a Matrix: An In-Depth Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "The rank of a matrix is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that measures the dimension of the vector space generated by its rows or columns. In simpler terms, it indicates the maximum number of linearly independent row or column vectors in the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Definitions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Row Rank**: The maximum number of linearly independent rows in the matrix.\n",
        "- **Column Rank**: The maximum number of linearly independent columns in the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theorem**: The row rank and column rank of a matrix are always equal. This common value is referred to as the **rank** of the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Find the Rank\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Form the Matrix**: Start with the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ for which you want to find the rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Row Echelon Form**: Use Gaussian elimination to reduce the matrix to Row Echelon Form (REF) or Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). This involves:\n",
        "   - Swapping rows.\n",
        "   - Multiplying rows by non-zero constants.\n",
        "   - Adding or subtracting multiples of rows from other rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Count the Non-Zero Rows**: The rank of the matrix is equal to the number of non-zero rows in its row echelon form.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Numerical Example\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the matrix:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
        "2 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n",
        "3 & 5 & 7\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Row Echelon Form**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Perform Gaussian elimination on $\\mathbf{A}$:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Subtract 2 times the first row from the second row.\n",
        "2. Subtract 3 times the first row from the third row.\n",
        "\n",
        "The matrix becomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
        "0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
        "0 & -1 & -2\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Further Reduction**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we can further simplify the third row by multiplying by -1:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",

        "0 & 1 & 2\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Count Non-Zero Rows**:\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 2 non-zero rows in the row echelon form, thus the rank of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = 2\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Properties of the Rank of a Matrix\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Range and Dimension**: The rank of a matrix indicates the dimension of the image (or range) of the linear transformation represented by the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Full Rank**: A matrix is said to have full rank if its rank is equal to the smallest of the number of its rows or columns. For an $m \\times n$ matrix, full rank is $ \\min(m, n) $.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Rank and Solutions**: The rank helps determine the number of solutions to a system of linear equations:\n",
        "   - If $\\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A} | \\mathbf{b})$, the system is consistent (has at least one solution).\n",
        "   - If $\\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A}) < \\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A} | \\mathbf{b})$, the system is inconsistent (has no solution).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Matrix Operations**: The rank is invariant under elementary row operations. That is, the rank of a matrix remains the same if you perform row swaps, scalar multiplications, or adding multiples of rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Rank of Product**: For any two matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$, the rank of their product satisfies:\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   \\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) \\leq \\min(\\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{A}), \\text{Rank}(\\mathbf{B}))\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Important Notes on Using Matrix Rank\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Applications**: Rank is crucial in various applications, including solving linear systems, determining linear independence, and understanding the properties of matrices in data science and statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Computational Methods**: In practice, the rank can be computed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or by using matrix decompositions like QR decomposition.\n",
