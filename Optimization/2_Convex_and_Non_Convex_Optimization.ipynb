        "### Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "A convex optimization problem is one where the objective function is convex, and the feasible region is a convex set. Mathematically, a function $f$ is convex if for any two points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in its domain and any $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the following holds:\n",
