        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter optimization is a critical aspect of machine learning that involves selecting the set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins, as opposed to other parameters that are learned during training.\n",

        "## Mathematical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "### Definition and Importance\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hyperparameters**: Parameters that control the learning process (e.g., learning rate, regularization parameters, number of layers in a neural network).\n",
        "- **Objective**: Minimize the validation error $L(\\theta, \\lambda)$, where $\\theta$ are the model parameters and $\\lambda$ are the hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Optimization Problem\n",
