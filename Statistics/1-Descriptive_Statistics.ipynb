        "\n",
        "Descriptive statistics summarize and organize the characteristics of a data set. This tutorial covers key concepts, mathematical background, and numerical examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Measures of Central Tendency\n",
        "\n",
        "**Measures of central tendency** describe the center of a data set. The three main measures are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mean** (Arithmetic Average)\n",
        "- **Median** (Middle Value)\n",
        "- **Mode** (Most Frequent Value)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mean\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\text{Mean} (\\mu) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i $$\n",
        "\n",
        "*Example:*\n",
        "\n",
        "Given data: 5, 8, 12, 20\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ \\mu = \\frac{5 + 8 + 12 + 20}{4} = \\frac{45}{4} = 11.25 $$\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Affected by Outliers**: The mean can be significantly affected by extreme values (outliers).\n",
        "2. **Mathematical Manipulation**: The mean is useful in further statistical calculations and algebraic manipulations.\n",
        "3. **Every Data Point Contributes**: Each data point affects the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Median\n",
        "\n",
        "The median is the middle value when the data set is ordered. If the number of observations is odd, the median is the middle value. If even, it is the average of the two middle values.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Example:*\n",
        "\n",
        "Given data: 5, 8, 12, 20 (even number of observations)\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordered data: 5, 8, 12, 20\n",
        "\n",
        "Median is $( \\frac{8 + 12}{2} = 10 )$\n",

        "Given data: 5, 8, 12 (odd number of observations)\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordered data: 5, 8, 12\n",
        "\n",
        "Median is 8\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Not Affected by Outliers**: The median is resistant to outliers and skewed data.\n",
        "2. **Positional Measure**: The median depends on the position of the data values.\n",
        "3. **Appropriate for Ordinal Data**: Suitable for ordinal data where the mean cannot be defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mode\n",
        "\n",
        "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Example:*\n",
        "\n",
        "Given data: 5, 8, 12, 8, 20\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode is 8\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Multiple Modes**: A data set can have more than one mode (bimodal, multimodal).\n",
        "2. **Not Affected by Extreme Values**: The mode is not influenced by outliers.\n",
        "3. **Applicable to Categorical Data**: The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Measures of Dispersion\n",
        "\n",
        "**Measures of dispersion** describe the spread of the data. The main measures are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Range**\n",
        "- **Variance**\n",
        "- **Standard Deviation**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Range\n",
        "\n",
        "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Example:*\n",
        "\n",
        "Given data: 5, 8, 12, 20\n",
        "\n",
        "Range = 20 - 5 = 15\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Simple Calculation**: Easy to compute.\n",
        "2. **Affected by Outliers**: Highly influenced by extreme values.\n",
        "3. **Ignores Distribution**: Does not provide information about the distribution between the minimum and maximum values.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Variance\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other number in the set.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Squared Units**: Variance is expressed in squared units of the original data.\n",
        "2. **Affected by Outliers**: Sensitive to extreme values.\n",
        "3. **Foundation for Standard Deviation**: Variance is a crucial component in calculating the standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Standard Deviation\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Key Properties:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Same Units**: Standard deviation is expressed in the same units as the original data.\n",
        "2. **Affected by Outliers**: Sensitive to extreme values.\n",
        "3. **Measure of Spread**: Provides a measure of how much the data varies from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Descriptive statistics provide a summary of data using measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. The mean, median, and mode describe the center, while range, variance, and standard deviation describe the spread.\n",
        "\n",
